Purpose: To calculate values of sine, cosine and exp using Series expansion

Specifications: Implemented in c++, these programs use the basic mathematical concepts and formulas of series expansion

Usage: Compile using any c++ compiler
	To run: Run the compiled file with following inputs as arguments: 
			1. Angle(in degrees; in case of Sine and Cosine) or Float(whose exp need to be calculated)
			2. n (as int)(Number of terms)

Parameter: n, Number of terms of series expansion to be used for calculation
