Benchmarked six standard codes: Digit Classification, Vehicle Detection, K-means clustering, Pedestrian detection, Series expansion and Image Compression, all implemented in C++. Studied the variation in runtime and accuracy with respect to various parameters on ARM processor (Raspberry Pi).
Digit Compression, Vehicle detection and Pedestrian detection are implemented using OpenCV library
